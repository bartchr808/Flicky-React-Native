# Flicky-React-Native
Added faster functionality to large format phones between switching apps. Used axis accelerometers to open di erent apps and utilities by bridging Android and iOS native code to Facebookâ€™s React Native Framework. Allowed users to customize sensivity and app selection.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Once project is downloaded locally, install [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html) and running these commands in the project root:

```
$ rm -r node_modules/
$ npm i
$ npm install react-native-modalbox@latest --save
$ npm install react-native-storage --save
```

### Running

Depends on if you want to run Android or iOS:

* Android) Download and setup a [Genymotion](https://www.genymotion.com/fun-zone/) emulator. Then while in the root, run:
```
$ react-native run-android
```
* iOS) Download and setup Xcode. Then similarly as Android, run this in the root:
```
$ react-native run-ios
```

## Built With

* [Genymotion](https://www.genymotion.com/fun-zone/) - The emulator for Android
* [react-native-modalbox](https://github.com/maxs15/react-native-modalbox) - Modal box library
* [react-native-storage](https://github.com/sunnylqm/react-native-storage) - Library for storing user's settings
* [React Native Material Design](https://github.com/react-native-material-design/react-native-material-design) - Android material design library
* [react-native-slider](https://github.com/jeanregisser/react-native-slider) - Custom slider library

## To Do

Fix some bugs in bridging the Android code for switching apps and accessing list of apps. Complete the iOS bridging. Publish to Google and Apple App stores.
